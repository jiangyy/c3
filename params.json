{"name":"C3: Crash Consistency Checker","tagline":"Crash Consistency Validation Made Easy","body":"## Are your program crash-safe?\r\n\r\nC3 automatically checks a software for potential data loss.\r\n\r\n## Using C3\r\n\r\nTo use C3, you just need to provide a manuscript - how to do the initial setup and how to run the program. The rest is as easy as clicking a button. There are samples in the `subjects` directory.\r\n\r\n1. (Do this only once is sufficent) If you have not started c3disk driver yet, you may start it by, which should be run as root:\r\n\r\n        > ./init\r\n\r\n2. Place your inital file-system snapshot and test recepie (manuscript.py) in a sub-directory (e.g., gzip). Then validate by (also requires root)\r\n\r\n        > ./validate gzip\r\n\r\n    It will generate a report for you.\r\n\r\nThe program contains kernel-parts, we suggest users try it in a virtual machine to avoid potential bugs.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies:\r\n\r\n1. Kernel: The c3disk driver requires a recent kernel (tested on 4.2). If you are using 3.x, there will be slight modification to the code. \r\n2. C libraries: libssl-dev (available in repository)\r\n3. Python libraries: pyautogui (depends on xlib, pil and tk)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
